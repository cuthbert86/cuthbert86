- 👋 Hi, I’m @cuthbert86
- 👀 I’m studying at Hallam University
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computing with a specialism in "smart computing" aka "internet of things" aka micro-computers.
-   I'm still trying to get into the habit of updating my latest work to GitHub so there are a few half finished projects on here and some work from my early days when I wasn't very good.

- 📫 How to reach me via email cuthbert.corp@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: Just for fun i've got a comedy youtube channel, there is a link to it in my profile.
