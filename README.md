- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to @cuthbert86 github code repositpories.  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve spent the last few years studying computing at Hallam University
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computing with a specialism in "smart computing" aka "internet of things" aka micro-computers.
-   I'm still trying to get into the habit of updating my latest work to GitHub so there are a few half finished projects on here and some work from my early days when I wasn't very good.
